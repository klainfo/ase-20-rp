Allow the user to create diagrams without selecting a classifier/operation
first
The UML standard says that a Collaboration diagram needs (can not 
exist
without) at least a ""Classifier"" or ""Operation"" - if I interpret the
standard well.
But a user should be able to start ArgoUML and draw some Collaboration
diagrams, without first defining e.g. a class.
Which would mean that, formally, the user is making a mistake here.
Hence the following proposal:
1 Do not downlight the collaboration & statechart diagram creation
functions any more - never.
2 Create a critic to warn for a missing classifier/operation/modelelement
for these diagrams.
3 Allow the user to change the namespace & represented xxx of a
collaboration & statemachine.","org.argouml.ui.explorer.rules.GoModelElementToContainedDiagrams

However, the throughput only had a small increase from 1 to 2 clients, and adding more clients did not increase the throughput.
