I have a custom (de)serialiser for an enumerated type, and it works perfectly when saving and loading a @Document annotated POJO.
It also works when building and executing a Query object.
However when used in an Update, it is either ignored, or called in situations where it shouldn't.
Please clone https://github.com/patrickherrera/converter_test.git for a full test application.
In brief there is a POJO and for the purposes of the test it has a static enum with the desired converters:
return new converter <allocation, string> {
return new converter <string, allocation> {
throw new illegalargumentexception
use full Enum name use short code
register in Spring boot application entry point
return new customconversions
There is a unit test that drives a few scenarios:
save first allocation confirm conversion in query
confirm conversion in query save with valid allocation
try {
convert allocation not serialize class converter_test
check allocation update
update value get MyPersistantObject.Allocation
use MyPersistantObject.Allocation converter to string
check value update
make sense
save for object query for object call converters on document
store name store Enum code
By use of a positive and negative case, it appears that the converter is being called correctly when used in the Query builder.
When it comes to an Update, the Enum is unable to be serialised correctly, and an exception is thrown to that effect.
use code back by Querying back from DB
So it appears that the customer converter for converting from my Enum is not called in this situation.
update other value in document
The BigDecimal is converted to a String by an existing converter I assume, but then my customer converter is called to try and convert the numeric String into an Allocation Enum which of course fails.
debug code be in customconversions
That second variant never seems to be called in MappingMongoConverter, but perhaps if that type information was passed then it would not use my Allocation converter.
Without type information it seems the default is just to use the first converter that can handle the input type, in this case a String.

We now have the problem that stopping such a Swarm service in version 2016.11.0 does not properly shutdown the Swarm container (or better the underlying `Server`).
I did a debug session and found out that there remains one non-daemon thread blocking the JVM shutdown.

The shutdown is clean and fast.

attach as zip
download procrun at http://mirror.serversupportforum.de/apache//commons/daemon/binaries/windows/commons-daemon-1.0.15-bin-windows.zip
1) Clone the github project and start a ""mvn package"" to produce the uber-jar, which is located in the ""swarm"" sub-module of that project.
2) Copy that uber-jar and both procrun executables (""prunsrv.exe"" and ""prunmgr.exe"") into a test directory.
For 64-bit OS's use the file ""amd64/prunsrv.exe"" (inside that procrun zip file).
Rename the file ""prunsrv.exe"" to ""testing-wfs.exe"" and the file ""prunmgr.exe"" to ""testing-wfsw.exe"".
3) Install a Windows service by running the command ""testing-wfs.exe //IS"".
Now this service can be configured by running the ""testing-wfsw.exe"" (a Windows GUI Tool for that purpose).
4) Configure the service as following:
5) Now start the service.
After a succesful start you can ""GET http://localhost:8080/hello"", which should result in a ""Hello World"" response.
6) The service has many threads running.
See first attached screenshot.
7) Now stop the service.
Windows will hang in that stopping attempt and spit out a failure message after some time.
The process is still running afterwards.
The log file shows some output that indeed a shutdown is initalized.
The GET does not work anymore.
8) The service still has many threads (especially non-daemon threads).

However, the throughput only had a small increase from 1 to 2 clients, and adding more clients did not increase the throughput. Looking at the test in a profiler, it seems like the threads are spending a lot of time waiting to enter synchronization blocks in GenericPreparedStatement.upToDate() and BaseActivation.checkStatementValidity() (both of which are synchronized on the a GenericPreparedStatement object).

The application is using the embedded Derby driver.
The application has two threads, and each thread uses its own connection.
There is a table named MYTABLE with column MYCOLUMN.
1. A thread prepares and executes the query SELECT MYCOLUMN FROM MYTABLE.
The prepared statement is stored in the statement cache (see org.apache.derby.impl.sql.GenericStatement for this logic)
2. After some time, the prepared statement becomes invalid or out-of-date for some reason (see org.apache.derby.impl.sql.GenericPreparedStatement)
3. Thread 1 begins a transaction and executes LOCK TABLE MYTABLE IN EXCLUSIVE MODE
4. Thread 2 begins a transaction and executes SELECT MYCOLUMN FROM MYTABLE.
The statement is in the statement cache but it is out-of-date.
The thread begins to recompile the statement.
To compile the statement, the thread needs a shared lock on MYTABLE.
Thread 1 already has an exclusive lock on MYTABLE.

5. Thread 1 executes SELECT MYCOLUMN FROM MYTABLE.

The correctness of the output was highly variable on my computer, for one of my co-workers it *almost* always failed, and for two other of my co-workers they didn't see any failures, so it's likely to be a race condition or something like that.

When the double value is a large, negative number with many digits in the fractional part, and the maximal denominator is a big, positive integer (in the 100'000s), two distinct bugs can manifest:
1: the constructor_ returns a positive Fraction.
Calling Fraction(-33655.1677817278, 371880) returns the fraction 410517235/243036, which both has the wrong sign, and is far away from the absolute value of the given value
2: the constructor_ does not manage to reduce the Fraction properly.
Calling Fraction(-43979.60679604749, 366081) returns the fraction -1651878166/256677, which should have* been reduced to -24654898/3831.

Then servers main-three and other-two register.
The HC sends a prepared response to a request.
This is the host rollout request to the slave from the DC with the response being the ops to invoke on the servers.
The HC reports sending a ""pre-prepare failed response"" to two requests.
These are the requests the DC has asked it to proxy to the servers.
The result of all this for the client is the following failure of a management op:

When the UnifiedTree finds a new file from the file system, it assumes that if the file is not an existing file, then it is a folder.
This is not always true, because for different reasons a file returned by java.io.File.list/listFiles may not actually exist (our CoreFileSystemLibrary#getStat() returns 0).
This problem appears to the user when executing refresh operations.
At the first moment, the file is found in the file system and assumed to be a folder, and a corresponding resource is created in the workspace.
At the second refresh, the folder corresponding to that resource is not found in the file system, and then it is removed from the workspace.
