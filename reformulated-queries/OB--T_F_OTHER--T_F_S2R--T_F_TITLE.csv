So it appears that the customer converter for converting from my Enum is not called in this situation.

The BigDecimal is converted to a String by an existing converter I assume, but then my customer converter is called to try and convert the numeric String into an Allocation Enum which of course fails.

That second variant never seems to be called in MappingMongoConverter, but perhaps if that type information was passed then it would not use my Allocation converter.
