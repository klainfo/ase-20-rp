This is not always true, because for different reasons a file returned by java.io.File.list/listFiles may not actually exist (our CoreFileSystemLibrary#getStat() returns 0).
At the first moment, the file is found in the file system and assumed to be a folder, and a corresponding resource is created in the workspace.
At the second refresh, the folder corresponding to that resource is not found in the file system, and then it is removed from the workspace.
And so on.","org.eclipse.core.internal.localstore.UnifiedTree:addChildrenFromFileSystem(UnifiedTreeNode, String, Object[], int)
