This is not always true, because for different reasons a file returned by java.io.File.list/listFiles may not actually exist (our CoreFileSystemLibrary#getStat() returns 0).

The shutdown is clean and fast.

After a succesful start you can ""GET http://localhost:8080/hello"", which should result in a ""Hello World"" response.
6) The service has many threads running.
See first attached screenshot.
Windows will hang in that stopping attempt and spit out a failure message after some time.
The process is still running afterwards.
The log file shows some output that indeed a shutdown is initalized.
The GET does not work anymore.
