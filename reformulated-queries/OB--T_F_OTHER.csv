However, the throughput only had a small increase from 1 to 2 clients, and adding more clients did not increase the throughput. Looking at the test in a profiler, it seems like the threads are spending a lot of time waiting to enter synchronization blocks in GenericPreparedStatement.upToDate() and BaseActivation.checkStatementValidity() (both of which are synchronized on the a GenericPreparedStatement object).

The correctness of the output was highly variable on my computer, for one of my co-workers it *almost* always failed, and for two other of my co-workers they didn't see any failures, so it's likely to be a race condition or something like that.

This is not always true, because for different reasons a file returned by java.io.File.list/listFiles may not actually exist (our CoreFileSystemLibrary#getStat() returns 0).
At the first moment, the file is found in the file system and assumed to be a folder, and a corresponding resource is created in the workspace.
At the second refresh, the folder corresponding to that resource is not found in the file system, and then it is removed from the workspace.
