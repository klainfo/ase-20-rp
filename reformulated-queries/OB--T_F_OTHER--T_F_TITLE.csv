So it appears that the customer converter for converting from my Enum is not called in this situation.

That second variant never seems to be called in MappingMongoConverter, but perhaps if that type information was passed then it would not use my Allocation converter.

A RowPair object with (RowA=1,RowB=2) isn't considered the same as (RowA=2,RowB=1).
This causes problems as CoocurencesMapper sometimes emits rowpairs in the first form and sometimes in the second form thus separating the cooccurences.
If I'm right, this is due to the fact that ordering of the WeightedCoocurrenceArray for one column isn't guaranteed to be the same as for another column.
