I ran the test on a machine with 8 CPUs and expected the throughput to be proportional to the number of concurrent clients up to 8 clients (the same as the number of CPUs). However, the throughput only had a small increase from 1 to 2 clients, and adding more clients did not increase the throughput. Looking at the test in a profiler, it seems like the threads are spending a lot of time waiting to enter synchronization blocks in GenericPreparedStatement.upToDate() and BaseActivation.checkStatementValidity() (both of which are synchronized on the a GenericPreparedStatement object).
