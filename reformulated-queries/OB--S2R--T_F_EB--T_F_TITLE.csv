I used 1.0.0.
M5 version, and the type information (under _class key) was stored with object when it was necessary to be able to read it from database later.
RELEASE version that broke my application as it saves the objects without type information and later it is impossible to read it back to java model.

During execution of convertToMongoType(...) (at line 851) removeTypeInfoRecursively(...) is called which clears type data saved earlier under _class key.
