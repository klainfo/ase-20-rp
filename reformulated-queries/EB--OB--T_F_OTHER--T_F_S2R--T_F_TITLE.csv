I used 1.0.0.
M5 version, and the type information (under _class key) was stored with object when it was necessary to be able to read it from database later.
work till upgrade work to 1.0.0
RELEASE version that broke my application as it saves the objects without type information and later it is impossible to read it back to java model.
What I found is that MappingMongoConverter.writeInternal(...) method that in turn calls addCustomTypeIfNecessary(...) (line 330) which puts type information into DBObject.
During execution of convertToMongoType(...) (at line 851) removeTypeInfoRecursively(...) is called which clears type data saved earlier under _class key.
