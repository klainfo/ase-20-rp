I used 1.0.0.
M5 version, and the type information (under _class key) was stored with object when it was necessary to be able to read it from database later.
work till upgrade work to 1.0.0
RELEASE version that broke my application as it saves the objects without type information and later it is impossible to read it back to java model.
What I found is that MappingMongoConverter.writeInternal(...) method that in turn calls addCustomTypeIfNecessary(...) (line 330) which puts type information into DBObject.
During execution of convertToMongoType(...) (at line 851) removeTypeInfoRecursively(...) is called which clears type data saved earlier under _class key.

This is not always true, because for different reasons a file returned by java.io.File.list/listFiles may not actually exist (our CoreFileSystemLibrary#getStat() returns 0).
This problem appears to the user when executing refresh operations.
At the first moment, the file is found in the file system and assumed to be a folder, and a corresponding resource is created in the workspace.
At the second refresh, the folder corresponding to that resource is not found in the file system, and then it is removed from the workspace.
