I used 1.0.0.
M5 version, and the type information (under _class key) was stored with object when it was necessary to be able to read it from database later.
work till upgrade work to 1.0.0
RELEASE version that broke my application as it saves the objects without type information and later it is impossible to read it back to java model.
What I found is that MappingMongoConverter.writeInternal(...) method that in turn calls addCustomTypeIfNecessary(...) (line 330) which puts type information into DBObject.
During execution of convertToMongoType(...) (at line 851) removeTypeInfoRecursively(...) is called which clears type data saved earlier under _class key.

I ran the test on a machine with 8 CPUs and expected the throughput to be proportional to the number of concurrent clients up to 8 clients (the same as the number of CPUs). However, the throughput only had a small increase from 1 to 2 clients, and adding more clients did not increase the throughput. Looking at the test in a profiler, it seems like the threads are spending a lot of time waiting to enter synchronization blocks in GenericPreparedStatement.upToDate() and BaseActivation.checkStatementValidity() (both of which are synchronized on the a GenericPreparedStatement object).
