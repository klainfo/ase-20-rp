I used 1.0.0.
M5 version, and the type information (under _class key) was stored with object when it was necessary to be able to read it from database later.
work till upgrade work to 1.0.0
RELEASE version that broke my application as it saves the objects without type information and later it is impossible to read it back to java model.
What I found is that MappingMongoConverter.writeInternal(...) method that in turn calls addCustomTypeIfNecessary(...) (line 330) which puts type information into DBObject.
During execution of convertToMongoType(...) (at line 851) removeTypeInfoRecursively(...) is called which clears type data saved earlier under _class key.

save type information to DBObject

When defining a class Catalog with a list of ""wrapped"" books:
The index ""name"" inherited from AbstractProduct is created (book2.content.name) inside ""catalog"" , but the index defined on the Book class itself (isbn) is not created as Spring Data Mongo is only inferring type infromation from the ProductWrapper class definition (ProductWrapper <T extends AbstractProduct>).
Spring Data MongoDB should be able to infer type information from the list declaration ( List<ProductWrapper<Book>> ), becoming aware that Catalog contains a list of Books, hence indexes defined on Book should be created.

We now have the problem that stopping such a Swarm service in version 2016.11.0 does not properly shutdown the Swarm container (or better the underlying `Server`).
I did a debug session and found out that there remains one non-daemon thread blocking the JVM shutdown.

The shutdown is clean and fast.

attach as zip
download procrun at http://mirror.serversupportforum.de/apache//commons/daemon/binaries/windows/commons-daemon-1.0.15-bin-windows.zip
1) Clone the github project and start a ""mvn package"" to produce the uber-jar, which is located in the ""swarm"" sub-module of that project.
2) Copy that uber-jar and both procrun executables (""prunsrv.exe"" and ""prunmgr.exe"") into a test directory.
For 64-bit OS's use the file ""amd64/prunsrv.exe"" (inside that procrun zip file).
Rename the file ""prunsrv.exe"" to ""testing-wfs.exe"" and the file ""prunmgr.exe"" to ""testing-wfsw.exe"".
3) Install a Windows service by running the command ""testing-wfs.exe //IS"".
Now this service can be configured by running the ""testing-wfsw.exe"" (a Windows GUI Tool for that purpose).
4) Configure the service as following:
5) Now start the service.
After a succesful start you can ""GET http://localhost:8080/hello"", which should result in a ""Hello World"" response.
6) The service has many threads running.
See first attached screenshot.
7) Now stop the service.
Windows will hang in that stopping attempt and spit out a failure message after some time.
The process is still running afterwards.
The log file shows some output that indeed a shutdown is initalized.
The GET does not work anymore.
8) The service still has many threads (especially non-daemon threads).

However, the throughput only had a small increase from 1 to 2 clients, and adding more clients did not increase the throughput. Looking at the test in a profiler, it seems like the threads are spending a lot of time waiting to enter synchronization blocks in GenericPreparedStatement.upToDate() and BaseActivation.checkStatementValidity() (both of which are synchronized on the a GenericPreparedStatement object).
I then changed the test slightly, appending a comment with a unique thread id to the ""VALUES 1"" statement.

The SerializationUtils problem arises because the SerializationUtils internally use the ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream that overrides the ObjectInputStream's resoleClass method without delegating to the super method in case of a ClassNotFoundException.
I understand the intention of the ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream, but this implementation should also implement a fallback to the original implementation.
For example:
throw IOException {
try { return Class.forName(name, false, classLoader)

The problem appears to be that when a dataset X gets LOADed twice, with things other than LOADs occurring between the loads (like a FOREACH GENERATE), a FOREACH GENERATE that is later performed on X doesn't always choose the correct columns.
The correctness of the output was highly variable on my computer, for one of my co-workers it *almost* always failed, and for two other of my co-workers they didn't see any failures, so it's likely to be a race condition or something like that.

see --name attribute given to name my rollout plan
When I then refer to it I use following command:
see id attribute given to rollout header operation
Yes, this is really minor issue, but I think that these two attributes used in aforementioned commands should be unified (preferably to name instead of id) as user might be confused when using it.

METHOD,eclipse-2.0,31779,2003-02-13T09:55:00.000-06:00,[resources] UnifiedTree should ensure file/folder exists,"use natives
When the UnifiedTree finds a new file from the file system, it assumes that if the file is not an existing file, then it is a folder.
This is not always true, because for different reasons a file returned by java.io.File.list/listFiles may not actually exist (our CoreFileSystemLibrary#getStat() returns 0).
This problem appears to the user when executing refresh operations.
At the first moment, the file is found in the file system and assumed to be a folder, and a corresponding resource is created in the workspace.
At the second refresh, the folder corresponding to that resource is not found in the file system, and then it is removed from the workspace.
And so on.
