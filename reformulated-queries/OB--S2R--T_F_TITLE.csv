There is a unit test that drives a few scenarios:
By use of a positive and negative case, it appears that the converter is being called correctly when used in the Query builder.
When it comes to an Update, the Enum is unable to be serialised correctly, and an exception is thrown to that effect.
So it appears that the customer converter for converting from my Enum is not called in this situation.
The BigDecimal is converted to a String by an existing converter I assume, but then my customer converter is called to try and convert the numeric String into an Allocation Enum which of course fails.
