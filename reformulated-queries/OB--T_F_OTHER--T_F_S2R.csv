Since the currentElement is not reset to the parent element after finishing the element (method: endElement) the method getPrefix recursively traverses the parents and finally causes the StackOverFlowError

By use of a positive and negative case, it appears that the converter is being called correctly when used in the Query builder.
When it comes to an Update, the Enum is unable to be serialised correctly, and an exception is thrown to that effect.

So it appears that the customer converter for converting from my Enum is not called in this situation.
update other value in document
The BigDecimal is converted to a String by an existing converter I assume, but then my customer converter is called to try and convert the numeric String into an Allocation Enum which of course fails.

That second variant never seems to be called in MappingMongoConverter, but perhaps if that type information was passed then it would not use my Allocation converter.
Without type information it seems the default is just to use the first converter that can handle the input type, in this case a String.

However, the throughput only had a small increase from 1 to 2 clients, and adding more clients did not increase the throughput. Looking at the test in a profiler, it seems like the threads are spending a lot of time waiting to enter synchronization blocks in GenericPreparedStatement.upToDate() and BaseActivation.checkStatementValidity() (both of which are synchronized on the a GenericPreparedStatement object).
