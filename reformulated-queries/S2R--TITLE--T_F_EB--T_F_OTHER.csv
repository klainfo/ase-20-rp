download procrun at http://mirror.serversupportforum.de/apache//commons/daemon/binaries/windows/commons-daemon-1.0.15-bin-windows.zip
1) Clone the github project and start a ""mvn package"" to produce the uber-jar, which is located in the ""swarm"" sub-module of that project.
2) Copy that uber-jar and both procrun executables (""prunsrv.exe"" and ""prunmgr.exe"") into a test directory.
For 64-bit OS's use the file ""amd64/prunsrv.exe"" (inside that procrun zip file).
Rename the file ""prunsrv.exe"" to ""testing-wfs.exe"" and the file ""prunmgr.exe"" to ""testing-wfsw.exe"".
3) Install a Windows service by running the command ""testing-wfs.exe //IS"".
Now this service can be configured by running the ""testing-wfsw.exe"" (a Windows GUI Tool for that purpose).
4) Configure the service as following:
5) Now start the service.

I ran the test on a machine with 8 CPUs and expected the throughput to be proportional to the number of concurrent clients up to 8 clients (the same as the number of CPUs). However, the throughput only had a small increase from 1 to 2 clients, and adding more clients did not increase the throughput. Looking at the test in a profiler, it seems like the threads are spending a lot of time waiting to enter synchronization blocks in GenericPreparedStatement.upToDate() and BaseActivation.checkStatementValidity() (both of which are synchronized on the a GenericPreparedStatement object).
I then changed the test slightly, appending a comment with a unique thread id to the ""VALUES 1"" statement.
